# Angular-Project-1-Tour-Of-Heroes
The Tour of Heroes tutorial covers the fundamentals of Angular. In this tutorial you will build an app that helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes.  This basic app has many of the features you'd expect to find in a data-driven application. It acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.
